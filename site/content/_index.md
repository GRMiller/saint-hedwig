  text: The St. Hedwig Park provides recreation, joy, and community to an estimated 33,000 people in Southwest Detroit. Seven schools, numerous youth and recreation leagues, countless families, and 900+ PK to 8th graders across the street at Academy of Americas call St. Hedwig their own. But for too long they've had to take care of it on their own. The Friends of St. Hedwig Park aims to build on the progress of the SHP Coalition and the City of Detroit. By working alongside an enthusiastic group of neighbors, coaches, teachers, and non-profits, we believe St. Hedwig Park is an unmistakable opportunity to enhance social, economic, and recreational activity in Southwest Detroit.
