  text: St. Hedwig Park provides recreation, joy, and community to an estimated 33,000 people in Southwest Detroit. Seven schools, countless families, numerous recreational leagues, and 900+ PK to 8th graders across the street at Academy of Americas call St. Hedwig their own.

St. Hedwig Park is an unmistakable opportunity to enhance social, economic, and recreational activity in Southwest Detroit.
