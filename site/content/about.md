    We believe in the power of parks to build communities out of neighborhoods,
    friends out of neighbors, neighbors out of strangers, and prosperity out of
    a shared public space.

    Friends of St. Hedwig Park is a collaborative group of individuals,
    businesses, and organizations who are working together to revive St. Hedwig
    Park, a city-owned, 13-acre gem of a Detroit park.
      
    We believe the power of parks not only provides safe spaces for playful
    youths and spreads joy and community, but also stimulates economic activity,
    improves tax base, lifts property values, and boosts the business
    conditions.

    The St. Hedwig Park Project is an opportunity to enhance social, economic,
    and recreational activity in Southwest Detroit.  

    Alongside an enthusiastic group of neighbors, coaches, youth groups,
    teachers, and students, we are committed to rebuilding and sustaining the
    park.  

    Site plans have been developed by karemer Design Group to extend the park's
    legacy and make it a further point of pride for its community.

    SHP is one of Detroit's very old planned public space. It was overseen by
    the Detroit Recreation Department for its entire existence until the mid
    1980s, when the city experienced financial crisises. For the last 30 plus
    years, Ishmael "Coach Ish" Lesdema and the SHP Coalition have cared for the
    park, and it's neighbors, more than anyone.


    Coach Ish has built trust, connections, community, and passion through his
    care for SHP. Recently, more groups and the city are starting to chip in. In
    2018, the city responded to a SHP Coalition request to demolish an unsafe
    structure. In no small part to Coach Ish, SHP Coalition, and Detroit PAL,
    the city is supportive of SHP rebuilding plans.

      area is below the poverty level and 21.3% of households don't have access
      to a vehicle.

      The nearly 1,000 students who attend the Academy of the Americas K-8
      Detroit Public School located across the street enjoy the park daily
      during their recess, team practices, and school games in SHP.
      Additionally, 6 other area schools use the park for practice and play

      Numerous Detroit-area recreation leagues use the field already. More will
      be able to use it as we rebuild
    - item: >-
      Community Leaders and families will have access to a new shelter (there is
      currently no shelter), restrooms, and hydration facilities, allowing for
      more members of the family to stay out at the park for longer, even on the
      hottest Michigan summer days.
