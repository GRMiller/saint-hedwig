  text: |-
    Friends of St. Hedwig Park is a collaborative group of individuals, businesses, and organizations who are working together to revive St. Hedwig Park, a city-owned, 13-acre gem of a Detroit park.
      
    We believe the power of parks not only provides safe spaces for playful youths and spreads joy and community, but also stimulates economic activity, improves tax base, lifts property values, and boosts the business conditions.

  title: History of St. Hedwig Park
  text: |-
    SHP is one of Detroit's very old planned public space. It was overseen by the Detroit Recreation Department for its entire existence until the mid 1980s, when the city experienced financial crisises. For the last 30 plus years, Ishmael "Coach Ish" Lesdema and the SHP Coalition have cared for the park, and it's neighbors, more than anyone.

    Coach Ish has built trust, connections, community, and passion through his care for SHP. Recently, more groups and the city are starting to chip in. In 2018, the city responded to a SHP Coalition request to demolish an unsafe structure. In no small part to Coach Ish, SHP Coalition, and Detroit PAL, the city is supportive of SHP rebuilding plans.
